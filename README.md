This repo is for the website (http://www.jpredman.github.io). It is mainly for my personal use to get more familiar with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Git, etc. 

Website was created using [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/), a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form.
